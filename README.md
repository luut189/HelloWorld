## HelloWorld

This repository is for me to test using *Neovim* to edit my code and practice using *git* in Terminal

## Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:
- `src`: Contains all of my source code
- `bin`: Contains all fo my class files (but is ignored by my `.gitignore` )
